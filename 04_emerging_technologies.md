# Blockchain
## Purpose

A blockchain is a secure technology that uses a distributed database instead of locating, storing, and maintaining data in a single location. Its decentralized database capability allows for addressing security concerns raised by numerous password confirmation tools available today. If a hardware failure occurs on a centralized database, it may cause all the data to be lost. This doesn’t happen to a distributed database, which makes it a very secure way to store sensitive information. Blockchains are resistant to data modification that once the data is recorded, it cannot be altered.

## Usage
- **In Education**:  

Student Record Keeping on blockchains is important, there’s a growing problem with fake diplomas and certificates where people can easily claim they graduated from a school when they really didn’t. Universities can store official student records and certificates directly since blockchain  is immutable, no one can alter or fake those certificates.

## Examples

- **In Education**:  
  **MIT Digital Diploma Project**Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) uses blockchain to offer digital diplomas that can be verified instantly by employers worldwide. Graduates get secure digital diplomas on the blockchain, which anyone can verify instantly using cryptographic proofs. There is no need to contact the institution to verify the authenticity of diplomas. It significantly reduces verification delays and administrative burdens.

  **Guard Time** The Estonian Government uses blockchain to provide real-time visibility into the state of electronic systems and  lifecycle management of patient records. It claims to enable immediate responses or reaction to any incidents before they escalate into larger-scale damages. It also secures both public and internal records as well as logs to combat insider threats and protect the integrity of information systems .
