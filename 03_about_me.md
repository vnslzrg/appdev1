## *Why I Want to Learn Git & GitHub*

###### I want to learn Git and GitHub because I believe there is still more I need to know. As an IS student, by learning these tools early, I will not only improve my technical abilities but also prepare myself for real-world teamwork. I believe this knowledge will give me an advantage in both academic projects and my future career in this field.
